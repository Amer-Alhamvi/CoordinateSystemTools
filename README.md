# CoordinateSystemTools
There two functionalities in this file

1/ Set the points of a polygon in the correct order so that no two lines intersect exept at the points

  Creat a new class with eg. x = CoordinateSystemTools((x0,y0), (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3))
  
  The order is corrected automatically
  
2/ Find if a point is inside of polygon of n sides

  x(x,y) returns a boolean
